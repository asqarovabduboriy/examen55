## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React.js
- React-router-dom
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
- Typescript
- React-hook-forms
- Yup
- Dayjs

### What I learned

OMG... Crasiest project i have ever built! Extremely difficult, a lot of math, changing and replacing things, hell yeah. Overall, I really developed my "developer mindset" with this challenge.

### Continued development

First time using framer motion, it's really simple and funny to use, but i think that i will use this tool rarely, specially because i can do the same thing with typescript + styled-components. Second time using react-hook-forms, i tried it some time ago in a very small form with very little validation and stuff, but after using it in a bigger project like this, i just feel in love with this tool XD. First time using Dayjs, i always used date-fns, but i saw that dayjs had a smaller package and it seemed to be easier... i wasn't wrong tho!
